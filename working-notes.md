--- Notes

Everything in software is about abstractions. 

 with billions of logic gates (called "transistors")
- A processor: You may have heard of a "CPU" (central processing unit) or "GPU" (graphical processing unit).
- 
-  takes instructions calculations  - a processor, which takes instructions to perform calculations (example: add number x and number y) and returns the result of those calculations

### What is software?
Software are thos





```js
// Software is organized into functions -  a collection of instructions to be called repeatedly

// <- this double slash means the computer ignores this line while reading the instructions (aka, a comment)

// define a function
function capitalize_string(oldString: string){ // the function takes an argument - data to bring into the execution of instructions
  const newString = [] // within the execution of instructions, we create a data structure in memory. A spot in memory is allocated to be used by the program, and this particular data structure ([]) holds information in a list
  const stringLength = oldString.length // read the "length" property off of the oldString, providing a number

  // declare a "for" loop - the computer will execute the same instructions i times
  // declare i = 0, until i is greater than stringLength, execute the code, and at the end, increment i by 1
  for (let i = 0; i < stringLength; i += 1) {
    
    if (oldString[i] === " ") {}
  }

}
